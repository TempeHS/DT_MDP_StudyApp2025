            The HSC year can feel overwhelming. With so many subjects, deadlines, and exams to juggle, it’s easy to lose track of your progress or feel stuck. That’s where goal setting becomes one of the most powerful tools you can use to stay focused, motivated, and in control of your studies. Setting clear, achievable goals can help you break the HSC down into manageable steps and give you direction when things start to feel chaotic. 
          </p>

          <h2>Why Goal Setting Matters in the HSC</h2>
          <p> Without goals, your HSC journey can become unfocused. You might spend time on tasks that aren’t as important or feel unsure about where to start. Setting specific goals helps you prioritise what’s most critical, whether it’s improving your exam technique, lifting your internal marks, or completing study notes by a certain date. Goals create purpose, track your progress, and help you measure your success along the way.</p>

            <p>In fact, goal setting is proven to improve performance because it gives you something to aim for. It can also increase motivation, help you manage stress, and boost your confidence as you achieve smaller milestones on the path to your bigger HSC outcomes.</p>
        <h2>SMART Goals: The Key to Effective Goal Setting</h2>
            <p>One of the best ways to set effective goals is to use the <strong>SMART goal </strong>framework:</p>
            <p><ul>
              <li><strong>S</strong>pecific: Your goal should be clear and specific, not vague. Instead of saying "I want to do well in English," say "I want to improve my essay writing skills by practicing one essay per week."</li>
              <li><strong>M</strong>easurable: You should be able to track your progress. For example, "I will complete 10 past paper questions by the end of the month."</li>
              <li><strong>A</strong>chievable: Your goal should be realistic and attainable. Don't set yourself up for failure with goals that are too ambitious.</li>
              <li><strong>R</strong>elevant: Make sure your goal aligns with your overall HSC objectives. It should contribute to your success in the subjects you care about.</li>
              <li><strong>T</strong>ime-bound: Set a deadline for your goal. This creates urgency and helps you stay on track.</li></ul></p>
        <h2>Short-term vs Long-term Goals</h2>
        <p>Effective HSC goal setting should include a mix of both <strong>short-term</strong> and <strong>long-term</strong> goals.</p>
        <ul><li><strong>Short-term goals:</strong> These might focus on daily or weekly targets, like finishing study notes for a module, completing a practice essay, or revising a particular topic.</li></ul>
        <ul><li><strong>Long-term goals:</strong> These could focus on your trial exam performance, ATAR target, or the amount of consistent study you want to build over the year.</li></ul>
