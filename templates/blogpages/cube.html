            When preparing for your HSC exams, it’s not enough to simply know your content—you need to know how to approach exam questions strategically. Many students lose marks not because they don’t know the answer, but because they misread or misinterpret what the question is actually asking. This is where the CUBE exam technique can make a real difference. It’s a simple, practical method that helps you carefully break down a question and craft a response that is targeted and high-scoring. </p>
<h2>What does C.U.B.E. stand for?</h2>
<p> The <strong> CUBE </strong> technique stands for:</p> 
<ol>
  <li><strong>Circle</strong> the verb - tells you how to structure your response</li>
  <li><strong>Underline</strong> key concepts - these are the topics you must address</li>
  <li><strong>Box</strong> limiting words - such as dates, locations or specific conditions that narrow the response</li>
  <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> and plan your response</li>
</ol> 
  
<p>Each step helps you slow down and methodically unpack the question so that you stay focused and organised. The first step is to circle the command words(checkout our 'Addressing the Verb' blog). These are words like explain, justify, compare, or evaluate—the instructions that tell you how to answer. Command words are the backbone of the question and directly shape your response. If you don’t follow them correctly, even the best answer can miss the mark.</p>
<!--Step 1-->
<h3><strong>Step 1:</strong> Circle the Verb</h3>
<p>The verb tells you what type of response you need to write.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><em>"Evaluate the impact of emerging technologies on the sustainability of a designed product."</em></p>
<p><strong>Circle: </strong> Evaluate</p>
<p>This means you must make a judgment, not just describe. You need to present positives, negatives, and a conclusion.</p>

<!--Step 2-->
<h3><strong>Step 2: </strong>Underline the Key Concepts</h3>
<p>The key conceppts are the core focus areas of the question</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><em>"Evaluate the impact of <strong>emerging technologies</strong> on the <strong>sustainability</strong> of a <strong>designed product"</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Underline: </strong>Emerging technologies, sustainability, designed product</p>
<p>These are the topics your response must directly address. Talking about technology in general, or unrelated products, will lose marks.</p>

<!--Step 3-->
<h3><strong>Step 3: </strong>Box the Limiting Words</h3>
<p><strong>Limiting words </strong>narrow the question’s focus and tell you exactly what is being asked.</p>
<h4>Example:</h4>
<p><em>"Evaluate the impact of emerging technologies on the sustainability of <strong>a designed product"</strong>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Box: </strong> a designed product</p>
<p>This is not asking about sustainability in general—it’s asking about one specific product. You need to choose an example and focus your entire answer on it.</p>

<!--Step 4-->
<h3><strong>Step 4: </strong>Evaluate and Plan</h3>
<p>Before you start writing, quickly ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What points must I cover?</li>
  <li>What is the best structure?</li>
  <li>How detailed should this answer be based on the marks?</li>
</ul>

<p>For example:</p>
  <li>Introduction: Briefly state the product and emerging technologies.</li>
  <li>Body Paragraph 1: Positive impacts on sustainability.</li>
  <li>Body Paragraph 2: Negative impacts or limitations.</li>
  <li>Conclusion: Final judgment on overall sustainability improvement.</li>

  <p></p>
<p>The reason the CUBE technique is so powerful is that it gives you a structured way to read and respond to questions, helping you avoid careless mistakes and boosting your confidence under exam pressure. Many HSC students lose marks because they rush through questions, misinterpret what’s required, or forget to link their answers directly to the question. Using CUBE regularly in your practice can help you develop disciplined, effective exam habits that improve your performance across all subjects.</p>

<p>Whether you’re working through past papers, doing timed practices, or revising key topics, using the CUBE technique can sharpen your question-analysis skills and help you pick up those crucial extra marks. It’s especially useful in subjects like English, Business Studies, PDHPE, and the Sciences, where exam questions are often layered and require careful reading.<p>

<p>At the end of the day, succeeding in the HSC isn’t just about working harder—it’s about working smarter. Adopting proven strategies like the CUBE exam technique can give you the edge you need.
