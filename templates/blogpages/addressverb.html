            Do you find yourself unable to gain full marks when answering an exam question? Maybe its because you have not addressed what the key verb is asking of you. 
            Below is a table of 5 the NESA key verbs, mark range, what they are asking and some synonyms that may appear in the exam:

<h3>Why Addressing the Verb is the Key to Success</h3>
<p> One of the most common reasons HSC students lose easy marks in exams is because they don’t properly address the verb in the question. It sounds simple, but focusing on the verb—the instruction word—is often what separates a Band 4 response from a Band 6 response. When you don’t answer in the way the question asks, you might provide great content, but you fail to meet the core requirements of the task. That’s why learning to address the verb directly is a game-changing exam strategy.</p>

<p>In every HSC question, the verb tells you what type of response is expected. Verbs like describe, explain, analyse, assess, and evaluate each demand a specific approach. For example, if a question asks you to describe something, you should provide the characteristics or features of the topic in a straightforward way. However, if the question asks you to evaluate, it’s not enough to just list or explain. You must make a judgment about the significance or effectiveness of something, often weighing both sides before coming to a conclusion. Failing to recognise this difference can cost you valuable marks.</p>
  
<p>Addressing the verb is not just about identifying it—it’s about shaping your entire answer around it. For instance, if the verb is analyse, you need to break the topic into parts and show how those parts relate to each other. Simply describing will not be enough. Similarly, if the question says justify, your answer must focus on providing reasons or evidence to support a specific decision or viewpoint. You can have excellent content, but if your response doesn’t align with the verb, markers will not award full marks because the question has not been properly answered.</p>
  
<p>This is why actively engaging with the verb should become a habit whenever you sit a practice paper, complete classwork, or do homework questions. Train yourself to slow down, circle the verb, and think carefully about what is required. Ask yourself: "What does this verb want me to do? How should I structure my answer to meet this expectation?" Addressing the verb is not an add-on—it’s the foundation of every high-scoring response.</p>
  
<p>It’s also important to understand that different verbs require different depths of response. For example, identify is often used for low-mark questions and usually just needs a simple statement. On the other hand, verbs like discuss or evaluate are used in extended responses and require detailed evidence, analysis, and a clear conclusion. Misreading this can result in giving too little or too much information, wasting time or missing marks.</p>
  
<p>The MyHSC study app is designed to help you master this skill by providing verb breakdowns, question-specific tips, and example responses that show what fully addressing the verb looks like in real exam conditions. By practising with a focus on the verb, you can avoid the trap of writing general answers and instead give responses that are direct, focused, and structured to match what the question is asking.</p>
  
<p>In the high-pressure environment of the HSC, it’s easy to rush and overlook simple things like the instruction word, but this is exactly where you can set yourself apart. Addressing the verb correctly shows the marker that you understand the question and can think critically within the framework they expect.</p>
  
<p>Remember, content alone won’t get you top marks—answering the question properly will. So next time you sit a practice paper, make it your priority to address the verb from the very beginning. Your future HSC results will thank you.
