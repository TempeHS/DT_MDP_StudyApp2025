          <p>
            Oftentimes, when we know there are tasks at hand that need to be
            completed, the easiest default thing we do is delay the start. The
            initial delay becomes a series of delays until the deadline in a
            matter of hours. At its core, not knowing where to begin your
            studies is rooted in procrastination, uncertainty, self doubt and
            lack of clarity. Letâ€™s unpack that.

            <strong>Procrastination</strong> can be defined as the continuous
            act of delaying a set task.

            For many students, procrastination stems from a mix of emotional and
            psychological barriers. Tasks may be perceived as boring or
            overwhelming, leading to a lack of motivation. Some students
            struggle with low confidence in their abilities, while others are
            perfectionists who delay starting until they feel conditions are
            ideal. A major contributing factor is also fear of failure, anxiety
            about performance, doubt in oneâ€™s abilities and constant
            distractions. Additionally, the anticipation of hard work or a lack
            of clarity around what's required can cause students to put things
            off. While procrastinating may offer short-term relief or
            gratification, it often builds up into long-term stressâ€”something
            many donâ€™t fully realize until itâ€™s too late.
          </p>
          <h3>Prepare and Plan</h3>
          <p>
            Effective preparation begnins when you have a clear understanding of
            what you are up against.
          </p>
          <p>
            Start by reviewing the content that will be assessed in your
            upcoming exam. Take the time to understand the
            <strong>type of exam </strong>you're sittingâ€”this is crucial, as the
            format often varies depending on your field of study. Determine
            whether your exam is:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Multiple choice</li>
            <li>Short answer</li>
            <li>Extended response</li>
            <li>Practical</li>
            <li>Essay Format</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Next, revise your notes regularly. If you havenâ€™t started yet, donâ€™t
            stressâ€”thereâ€™s no better time to begin than now. Build a habit of
            reviewing content after each lesson to keep it fresh and manageable.
            Finally, take note of how much time remains before the exam, and use
            this to structure your study plan. The earlier you begin, the more
            confident and prepared you'll feel on the day.
          </p>
          <h3>Time Management</h3>
          <p>Create a study plan that works for you. A well-balanced study plan is key to staying on top of your exams
            without burning out. </p>
          <p>
            ðŸ“…Aim to distribute your study sessions evenly throughout the week
            while still making space for the other parts of lifeâ€”because
            everything is best in moderation!
          </p>
          <p>ðŸ“’Start by using a weekly planner to map out your
            commitments, including school, work, social events, and rest. Then,
            look for gaps in your schedule where you can slot in short, focused
            study sessions. Research shows that short, intense periods of study
            are far more effective than long, drawn-out hours when youâ€™re
            already tired or distracted.
          </p>
            ðŸ’¡Tip!: Avoid studying when you're exhausted. Your brain retains
            very little when itâ€™s running on low energy. Instead, prioritize
            rest, and study in shorter bursts when you're alert and focused.
            Youâ€™ll learn more in less time and feel better doing it.
